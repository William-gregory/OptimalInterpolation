These 'quick-look' data have been generated by assigning pre-computed estimates of each of the model hyperparameters for the Gaussian Process Regression model (see the published article, referenced in the main repository). This enables us to generate daily pan-Arctic freeboards much quicker, as we do not need to do any numerical optimisation. The pre-computed hyperparameters are given as the seasonal average of each respective hyperparameter, produced from running the interpolation at 50x50 km resolution. The average hyperparameter fields were then re-gridded to 25km and used to generate these data here. Some preliminary tests conducted by the authors have shown that the quick-look data appear to be robust, and are able to reproduce very similar results shown in Sections 4 and 5 of the published article.
